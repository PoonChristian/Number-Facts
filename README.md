A simple Vanilla JS app that parses user input and asynchronously accesses the Numbers API (http://numbersapi.com/) with AJAX and Fetch.

# What I Learned

* Difference between AJAX and Fetch API
* Update UI with API data - DOM Manipulation
* Utilize dropdown menu to configure different options for the API
